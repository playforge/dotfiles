dotfiles
========

I keep a pretty vanilla setup, so there shouldn't be any requirements for these.

###.vimrc
Pretty plain. Mostly syntax highlighting and line/column numbers. Tab = 2 spaces.

###.vimperatorrc
This won't do anything if you don't have Vimperator installed. By default Vimperator's kind of loud and ugly, so I fixed that.

###.gitconfig
Just colors
